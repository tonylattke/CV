I am computing enginner from ``Universidad Simón Bolívar'' (Caracas, Venezuela) with specialization in Computer graphics, artificial inteligence and programming languages.

\vspace*{2mm}

As a programmer I am really good working on old code, also I can generate a new code for a project. I am proficient in a big area of programming languages from parsing languages, code generation and many complex algorithms development. I think that knowing only one programming language very well is not enough, I rather to know which programming language is better for the solution of the problem. I am excellent team worker, I share and listen ideas for the improvement of a project.
